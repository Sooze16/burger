###  How the app works:
This project calls the user to enter their burger of choice.  When you place an order, the burger you enter in the form field is added to the list of burgers on the left side of the screen. Each burger in the list has a <b>"fa fa-usd"</b> button. Clicking this button moves the burger from the list on the left side of the screen to the list on the right. The list on the right is a list of burgers that are ready to be picked up. Each burger in this list has a <b>"fa fa-cutlery"</b> button that allows you to remove the burger, which deletes the burger from the user interface as well as from the MySQL database.
